In [this notebook](https://github.com/pmandiola/pui_final/blob/master/PUI_final_pmb434.ipynb) you can find my answer to the exam, for which we had one weekend to work on.

## Modeling school performance of NYC students as a function of crime, drugs, and living conditions

There is a known connection between school performance and the environment that a child is exposed to, including environmental conditions that may affect health, exposure to violence which affects stress level, and socioeconomic features, including income, which may determine the ability of a student to get help. Nonetheless, the modeling of school performance is difficult, as measures of performance may be biased and environmental features hard to measure.

In this exam, we tried to model performance, measured through school SAT score, of NYC students as a function of exposure to crime, measured through reports of crimes in school, living conditions, measured through the incidence of respiratory and drug related issues in the area, and optionally income.
